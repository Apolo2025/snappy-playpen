# Contributing to Snappy Playpen

Snappy Playpen is a learning project, so we don't place too many restrictions
on the projects add to it. For your project to be added, it is important that:

 - it builds by just running `snapcraft cleanbuild` in the directory
 - you add a `README.md` file to your directory which explains
   - what your project is about
   - what others can learn from it
   - what the level of completion is
   - what still needs to be done
 - you update the software table in the top-level `README.md` file

Use `template.README.md` to kickstart your project.
