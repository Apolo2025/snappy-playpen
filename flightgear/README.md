# FlightGear snap

This project creates a working snap of FlightGear from upstream git.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - Build simgear
 - Build flightgear
 - Bundle data files

## Current state

Working features:
 - In progress

Known issues:
  - Audio doesn't work, but this is a problem with snappy, not this snap
