# GIMP-from-git-snapcraft 

This project is a work in progress to build GIMP (and its dependencies)
from the git repositories.

---

Having built GIMP before successfully from source, using information from
several places, and being very interested in the future of Ubuntu I wanted
to try out snapcrafting. Because there are several `parts` to build, which
are order sensitive, and having a large number of dependencies, which
requires some environment configuration, this is not something I expect to
do without some help. However, I really want to show enthusiasm for the
new package format and the Ubuntu project, the marquee applications in the
FLOSS ecosystem should be built as `snap` packages as soon as possible.
