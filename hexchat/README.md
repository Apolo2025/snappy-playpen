# HEXCHAT snap

This project creates a working snap of hexchat.

## Current state

Working features: The snap can successfully install hexchat

Known issues: We use a fork of hexchat (https://github.com/hikiko/hexchat) until
a compile error in the master hexchat branch is fixed (there has been a merge
proposal).

TODO: replace the fork branch with the master branch as soon as the compile
error is fixed.
