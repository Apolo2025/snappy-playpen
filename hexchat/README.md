# HexChat snap

This project creates a working snap of HexChat.

## Current state

Working features: The snap can successfully install hexchat

Known issues: This snap currently uses a fork of HexChat
(https://github.com/hikiko/hexchat) until a compile error in the master hexchat
branch is fixed (there has been a pull request).

TODO: replace the forked repository with the master repository as soon as the
compile error is fixed.
