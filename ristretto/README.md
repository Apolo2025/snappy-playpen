# ristretto snap

This project creates a working snap of `ristretto`.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - use gtk-launch wiki part
 - build from current git
 - run using `--devmode`

## Current state

Working features:
 - viewing/editing pictures

Known issues:
  - no thumbnailer service, even though tumbler is included, maybe
    wrong path?

TODO:
 - fix tumbler issue
