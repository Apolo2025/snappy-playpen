# ScummVM snap

This project creates a working snap of ScummVM.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - add custom launcher
 - build from current git

## Current state

Working features:
 - Games :)

Known issues:
  - No theme for the main UI
  - No sound
  - the home plug needs to be connected manually after snap install with 
    "sudo snap connect scummvm:home ubuntu-core:home"
