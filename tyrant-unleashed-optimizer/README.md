# tyrant-unleashed-optimizer snap

This project creates a working snap of tyrant-unleashed-optimizer (tuo)

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - build from current git
 - fetch and provide some initial data in the snap (out of tree)
 - add a basic cardlist data as parts

## Current state

Working features:
 - all WIP

Known issues:
  - the home plug needs to be connected manually after snap install with
    "sudo snap connect tyrant-unleashed-optimizer:home ubuntu-core:home"
